# Katamari-2d

## Background and Overview

Katamari 2d is a 2d clone of the cult classic Katamari Damacy. In Katamari Damacy, the player is tasked with building the biggest *Katamari*, or clump, possible by rolling the existing Katamari over any objects in the environment which are smaller than the player's Katamari. As the Katamari picks up objects, it grows, allowing the player to pick up larger objects and build an even bigger Katamari!

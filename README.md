# Katamari-2d

## Background and Overview

Katamari 2d is a 2d clone of the cult classic Katamari Damacy. In Katamari Damacy, the player is tasked with building the
biggest *Katamari*, or clump, possible by rolling the existing Katamari over any objects in the environment which are smaller than the player's Katamari. As the Katamari picks up objects, it grows, allowing the player to pick up larger objects and build an even bigger Katamari!

## Technologies

As this project will require many components, it will be implemented using the following library:

* [Phaser] http://phaser.io, a Javascript game engine which handles the game loop, asset loading, and game physics

## Implementation Timeline: 

### Over the weekend

Complete Phaser tutorial

### Day 1

* Collect all assets: images, spritesheets, sounds, etc
* Create player character and Katamari rolling animation
* Brainstorm ways to dynamically alter the appearance of the Katamari after a successful pick-up. Eg: the player rolls over
a cat, there is permanently a cat stuck to the Katamari

### Day 2 

* Implement changing Katamari appearance - growth and stuck-on items
* Implement randomly generated items

### Day 3

* Level design

### Day 4 

* Implement controls, tweak physics
* Install title, instructions and other extras on the page.
